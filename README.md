# nicos-misc

Repository for miscellaneous, NICOS related things that don't fit anywhere else.

## cachereg 

Utility taken from the [FRM2 Boxtool](https://forge.frm2.tum.de/cgit/cgit.cgi/frm2/general/boxtools.git/tree/cachereg/cachereg) to auto register plug and play sample environment devices in the NICOS cache.

Some changes have been made to allow it to work on fitlet machines in Utgard.
